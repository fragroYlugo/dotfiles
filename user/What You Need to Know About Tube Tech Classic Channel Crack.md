# How to Get the Vintage Sound of Tube-Tech Classic Channel for Free
 
If you are looking for a way to add some warmth and character to your mixes, you might be interested in the Tube-Tech Classic Channel plugin by Softube. This plugin is a channel strip that combines three classic Tube-Tech hardware units: the PE 1C "Pultec" equalizer, the ME 1B mid-range equalizer, and the CL 1B opto compressor. Together, they form a powerful and versatile tool for shaping your sound with a vintage vibe.

However, the Tube-Tech Classic Channel plugin is not cheap. It costs $449 on the Softube website, which might be out of reach for some home studio owners. But don't worry, there is a way to get the same sound quality for free. All you need is a bit of creativity and some free plugins that emulate the Tube-Tech components.
 
Here is how you can create your own Tube-Tech Classic Channel crack using free plugins:
 
1. Download and install the following plugins: TDR Nova by Tokyo Dawn Labs, PTEq-X by Ignite Amps, and TDR Kotelnikov by Tokyo Dawn Labs. These are all high-quality plugins that are available for Windows and Mac in VST, AU, and AAX formats.
2. Insert TDR Nova on your track as the first plugin. This is a dynamic equalizer that can act as a compressor as well. Set the mode to "Wide" and enable the "High Quality" option. Use the first band as a low-shelf filter with a frequency of 60 Hz and a gain of 3 dB. Use the second band as a high-shelf filter with a frequency of 12 kHz and a gain of 2 dB. Use the third band as a dynamic band with a frequency of 3 kHz, a Q of 0.7, a threshold of -18 dB, and a ratio of 4:1. Adjust the attack and release times to taste. This will emulate the PE 1C equalizer.
3. Insert PTEq-X on your track as the second plugin. This is a Pultec-style equalizer that can boost and cut the same frequency at the same time. Enable the "MEQ-5" section and use it to shape your mid-range frequencies. For example, you can boost 200 Hz by 2 dB, cut 500 Hz by 3 dB, and boost 5 kHz by 1 dB. This will emulate the ME 1B equalizer.
4. Insert TDR Kotelnikov on your track as the third plugin. This is a transparent compressor that can handle fast transients and smooth out dynamics. Set the mode to "Classic" and enable the "Delta" option. Use the "Auto" settings for attack and release times. Set the threshold to -12 dB and the ratio to 4:1. Adjust the makeup gain to match the input level. This will emulate the CL 1B compressor.

And there you have it! You have created your own Tube-Tech Classic Channel crack using free plugins. Of course, this is not an exact replica of the original plugin, but it will give you a similar sound quality and character. You can tweak the settings to suit your taste and source material.
 
Try this method on your vocals, drums, guitars, or any other track that needs some vintage warmth and punch. You might be surprised by how good it sounds!
