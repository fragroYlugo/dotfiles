Sutra Ungu was first published in 2006 by Rumah Dzikir, a publisher based in Solo, Indonesia. The book has become a bestseller and has received positive reviews from readers and critics. The book has also been translated into several languages, such as English, Arabic, Malay, and Urdu. The book is available in both print and digital formats.
 
Sutra Ungu is not only a book about sex, but also a book about love, respect, spirituality, and worship. The book shows that Islam does not forbid or neglect sexual pleasure, but rather regulates and elevates it to a higher level of morality and dignity. The book also shows that sexual intercourse is not only a physical act, but also a psychological, emotional, and spiritual bond between husband and wife that reflects their mutual devotion and commitment to each other and to God.

Despite these challenges, Sutra Ungu remains one of the most popular and influential books on sexual ethics in Islam in Indonesia and beyond. The book has inspired several other books on similar topics, such as Tenda Salju (Snow Tent) by the same author, which is a sequel to Sutra Ungu. The book has also been adapted into a film titled Kabut Sutra Ungu (Mist of Purple Silk) in 1979, directed by Sjumandjaja and starring Jenny Rachman and Roy Marten. The film was a commercial and critical success, winning four Citra Awards at the 1980 Indonesian Film Festival.
