Note: If youâre on Windows 7/ Vista, restart your computer, then press and tap the F8 key until you see Advanced Boot Options. Use the arrow keys to select Disable Driver Signature Enforcement.
 
## Step 3: Install the Driver Manually
 
The third step is to install the driver manually on your computer. To do this, you need to follow these steps:

- Type device manager in the search box and select Device Manager.
- In Device Manager, select your PC name. Then click Action and select Add legacy hardware.
- In the Add Hardware Wizard, click Next.
- Tick the Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced) option and click Next.
- Click Show All Devices and then Next.
