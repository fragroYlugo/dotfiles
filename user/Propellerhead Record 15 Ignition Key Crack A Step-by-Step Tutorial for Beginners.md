The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author Ayn Rand, her first major literary success[^7^]. The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an intransigent young architect, who battles against conventional standards and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation[^7^]. In Howard Roark, Ayn Rand exemplifies the notion that individualism is to be valued over collectivism[^8^].
 
The novel takes place in the United States, mostly in New York City, during the 1920s and 1930s[^6^]. It chronicles the struggles of Roark in his effort to achieve success on his own terms. He faces opposition from his former classmates, Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey, who represent the conformist and socialist forces in architecture respectively. He also falls in love with Dominique Francon, a brilliant and cynical woman who admires his genius but believes that he has no chance in a corrupt world[^4^].

The Fountainhead is a novel of ideas that explores themes such as individualism, creativity, integrity, altruism, collectivism, and power. It also presents Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, which holds that reality exists independently of human perception, that reason is the only valid source of knowledge, that human beings have an inherent right to pursue their own happiness, and that the role of art is to express the artist's vision of reality[^7^]. The novel has been praised for its originality, style, and characterization, but also criticized for its didacticism, moral absolutism, and glorification of violence[^7^].
 
The Fountainhead has been translated into many languages and has sold over six million copies worldwide[^7^]. It has also been adapted into a film, a play, a musical, and a video game. The novel has influenced many artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and political figures, such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Neil Peart, Steve Jobs, Paul Ryan, and Narendra Modi[^7^].

## Plot Summary
 
The Fountainhead is divided into four parts, each named after a major character in the novel. The first part, Peter Keating, introduces the protagonist, Howard Roark, and his antagonist, Peter Keating. Roark is expelled from Stanton Institute of Technology for refusing to follow the traditional rules of architecture. He moves to New York City and works for Henry Cameron, an old and unpopular architect who shares Roark's modernist vision. Keating graduates with honors from Stanton and joins Francon & Heyer, a prestigious architectural firm run by Guy Francon. Keating is ambitious and manipulative, and quickly rises to fame and fortune by pleasing his clients and bosses. He also courts Dominique Francon, Guy's daughter and a columnist for The New York Banner. Dominique is beautiful and intelligent, but also cynical and disillusioned with society. She recognizes Roark's genius when she sees one of his buildings, but believes that he is doomed to fail in a world that does not appreciate him.
 
The second part, Ellsworth Toohey, focuses on the rise of Ellsworth Toohey, an influential socialist writer and critic who works for The New York Banner. Toohey is a master of propaganda and manipulation, who seeks to destroy individualism and promote collectivism in every aspect of life. He befriends Keating and uses him as a tool to advance his agenda. He also tries to sabotage Roark's career by writing negative reviews of his work and influencing his clients. Roark struggles to find commissions and has to close his office. He takes a job at a granite quarry in Connecticut, where he meets Dominique again. They have a passionate affair, but Dominique breaks it off when she realizes that she loves him too much to see him suffer. She marries Keating instead, hoping to hurt both herself and Roark. Roark returns to New York when he is hired by Roger Enright, a wealthy businessman who admires his work. He designs the Enright House, a revolutionary apartment building that attracts attention and admiration.
 
The third part, Gail Wynand, introduces Gail Wynand, the owner and publisher of The New York Banner. Wynand is a self-made tycoon who rose from poverty to power by catering to the lowest common denominator of the public. He controls the opinions and tastes of the masses through his sensationalist newspaper. He meets Dominique on a cruise and falls in love with her. He also meets Roark and becomes his friend and patron. He commissions Roark to design his new home, the Wynand Building, which is meant to be the tallest and most magnificent skyscraper in the city. Wynand is unaware of Dominique's past relationship with Roark, but he senses a bond between them. He also discovers that Toohey has been using his paper to spread his socialist propaganda. He decides to fire Toohey and expose his schemes.
 
The fourth part, Howard Roark, depicts the climax and resolution of the novel. Toohey retaliates against Wynand by inciting a public outcry against Roark's design for a public housing project called Cortlandt Homes. He convinces one of the commissioners, Hopton Stoddard, to sue Roark for changing the original plans without permission. Roark defends himself in court by explaining his philosophy of architecture and individualism. He argues that he has the right to create according to his own vision, and that no one has the right to alter or destroy his work without his consent. He also reveals that he dynamited Cortlandt Homes when he learned that it had been altered by others. The jury acquits him of all charges, recognizing his integrity and genius.
 
Wynand tries to support Roark by using his paper to defend him, but he loses his readership and influence as a result. He realizes that he has betrayed his own values by pandering to the mob for so long. He also learns that Dominique and Roark love each other, and he gives her a divorce so that she can marry Roark. He then shoots himself in his office, lea
