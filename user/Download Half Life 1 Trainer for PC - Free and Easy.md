If you want to have some fun with the game and make it easier or harder, you can use a trainer. A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats, such as unlimited health, ammo, or flashlight. Trainers are usually designed for specific versions of the game, so you need to find one that matches your game version.
