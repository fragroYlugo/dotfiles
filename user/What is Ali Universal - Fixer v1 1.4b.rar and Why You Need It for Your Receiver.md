Rhino Terrain is a plugin for Rhino 5 that allows you to easily create digital terrain models (DTMs) from various sources of data, such as photogrammetry, topography, LIDAR, or point clouds. It is based on a robust and reliable constrained triangulation algorithm that can handle huge data volumes and produce accurate and realistic 3D models. In this article, we will show you how to use Rhino Terrain for Rhino 5 to create your own DTMs and enhance your geo-modeling experience.

## Importing Data
 
The first step is to import your data into Rhino 5. Rhino Terrain supports various formats of data, such as ArcInfo ASCII, USGS DEM, SRTM HGT, ESRI ShapeFile, GeoTiff, XYZ ASCII, LAS, Leica Cyclone PTS, Topcon CL3, LandXML, and JPGIS GML. You can also import raster images such as ECW tiles or orthophotos. To import data, go to the RhinoTerrain menu and select Import. Then choose the format of your data and browse to the file location. You can also drag and drop files into the Rhino viewport.
 
## Creating DTM
 
Once you have imported your data, you can create a DTM from it using Rhino Terrain. To do this, go to the RhinoTerrain menu and select Create DTM. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the settings for the DTM computation. You can specify the maximum number of points to use, the tolerance for break lines, the coordinate system, and the output mesh type. You can also choose to create a point cloud or a NURBS surface from the DTM. Click OK to start the computation.

## Editing DTM
 
After creating a DTM, you can edit it using various tools provided by Rhino Terrain. For example, you can control, add, or edit break lines to define sharp edges or boundaries in your terrain. You can also inverse and unify normals, delimitate, decimate, smooth, project curves on mesh, extract from closed curves, cut by objects or curves, perform boolean operations, simplify and align 3D curves, offset 3D curves, and more. To access these tools, go to the RhinoTerrain menu and select Edit.
 
## Analyzing DTM
 
Rhino Terrain also offers several tools for analyzing your DTM according to different criteria. For example, you can color slope or altitude to visualize the gradient or elevation of your terrain. You can also perform viewshed analysis to determine the visible areas from a given point or direction. You can also compute area and volume of your terrain or any part of it. You can also create and annotate contour lines to show the elevation contours of your terrain. To access these tools, go to the RhinoTerrain menu and select Analyze.
 
## Mapping Orthophotos
 
One of the features of Rhino Terrain is that it allows you to map orthophotos on your DTM to create realistic textures for your terrain. Orthophotos are aerial photographs that have been corrected for distortion and perspective and aligned with a coordinate system. Rhino Terrain can handle ECW tiles and orthophotos in various formats. To map orthophotos on your DTM, go to the RhinoTerrain menu and select Imagery > Orthophoto Mapping. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the orthophoto file and adjust the settings for the mapping. Click OK to apply the texture to your DTM.
 
## Conclusion
 
Rhino Terrain is a powerful plugin for Rhino 5 that allows you to easily create digital terrain models from various sources of data. It is based on a robust and reliable constrained triangulation algorithm that can handle huge data volumes and produce accurate and realistic 3D models. You can also edit and analyze your DTMs using various tools provided by Rhino Terrain. You can also map orthophotos on your DTMs to create realistic textures for your terrain. Rhino Terrain is suitable for anyone who may have an interest in geo-modeling, such as architects, surveyors, engineers, designers, etc.[^1^] [^2^]
