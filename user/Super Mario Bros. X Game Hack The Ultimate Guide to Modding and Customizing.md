Super Mario Bros. X (SMBX) is a fan-made tribute to the classic Mario games, combining elements from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World. It features five playable characters, over 60 levels, a level editor, co-op mode, battle mode and more. SMBX was originally released in 2009, but was made open source in 2020 and ported to C++ by developer Wohlstand under the name TheXTech.
 
Now, thanks to developer Axiom, you can play TheXTech on your PS Vita as well. Axiom has released the first version of his Vita port of TheXTech, which is based on the latest master branch of the C++ version. You can download the game from the project's GitHub page[^1^], but you will also need to download some assets from one of the desktop versions of TheXTech. You can use any game that uses TheXTech engine, but the most popular one is the SMBX config.

1. Ensure you have extracted libshacccg.suprx
2. Download and install thextech.vpk

5. Create a folder on your Vita named "TheXTech" (case matters) in ux0:data
6. Move the listed folders and files from your computer to ux0:data/TheXTech
7. Launch the game and enjoy!

TheXTech for PS Vita is a great way to experience SMBX on your handheld device. You can play solo or with a friend in co-op mode, create your own levels with the level editor or try out some of the custom levels made by other fans.
