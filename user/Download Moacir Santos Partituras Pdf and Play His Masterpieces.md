Moacir Santos was a genius of Brazilian music who left a legacy of beauty and creativity that deserves to be known and appreciated by more people. His songbook is a great opportunity to discover his music and learn from his mastery.
  
Moacir Santos was born on July 26, 1926 in Flores do PajeÃº, Pernambuco. His mother died when he was two years old, and as his father had already left the family, he was taken in by another family. He grew up in poverty but his adoptive family assisted him with attending school and music lessons. By age 14, he could play the saxophone, banjo, guitar and mandolin. As a teenager, he played in the band of the Military Police of Parabia and later became the band's conductor. He eventually ran away from home, becoming an itinerant musician moving around Pernambuco looking for employment and even, for a time, working in a travelling circus.

In 1948, Santos moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he worked as a saxophonist and conductor at a dance club and at RÃ¡dio Nacional. He studied with Hans-Joachim Koelreutter, a German composer and teacher who introduced him to modern harmony and classical music. He also became a private tutor for many young musicians who would later become famous in the Bossa Nova movement. Santos composed songs with Vinicius de Moraes, one of the most renowned Brazilian poets and lyricists. He also wrote scores for several Brazilian films, such as The Guns (1964) by Ruy Guerra and Ganga Zumba (1963) by CacÃ¡ Diegues.
 
In 1967, Santos and his wife, Cleonice, moved to Pasadena, California, hoping to work in Hollywood. However, he faced many difficulties and prejudices as a black Brazilian immigrant. He continued to teach music from his home and met some American jazz musicians who admired his work, such as Horace Silver and Kenny Burrell. He also recorded some albums for Blue Note Records, such as The Maestro (1972), which was nominated for a Grammy Award. His music was praised by critics but did not reach a large audience. He died on August 6, 2006 at the age of 80.
 
Moacir Santos was a brilliant and original composer who created a unique musical language that combined Brazilian rhythms and melodies with jazz harmonies and orchestration. His songbook is a testament to his genius and creativity, as well as his generosity and dedication as a teacher. His music deserves more recognition and appreciation by the public and by other musicians.
